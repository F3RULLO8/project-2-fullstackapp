# project-2-fullstackapp
Project 2, first project on a full stack application. 
# Technologies Used
I used html, css, javascript, express, mongo, and handlebars. The html and css was used for the layout and lookds for the application. The javascript, express, and handle bars were used to communicate with my server base and to controller the routes, controllers, views, and my models. While mongo was used to actually start my server base. I used express to get full CRUD working on the application as well. 
# The approach taken
My approach was to start at the routers than work my way though every section while referenceing the twitter and todo examples if I was confuesed or needed some help. 
# Features
There is fully working CRUD, user authentication, and communicates with the server to get the collections. You can create a user and save your favorite gifs and see them while commenting on your friends or yours aswell. You can create new gifs and have comments, delte them, and view other peoples aswell.
